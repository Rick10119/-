	abstract = {Large-scale battery storage will become an essential part of the future smart grid. This paper investigates the optimal bidding strategy for battery storage in power markets. Battery storage could increase its profitability by providing fast regulation service under a performance-based regulation mechanism, which better exploits a battery's fast ramping capability. However, battery life might be decreased by frequent charge-discharge cycling, especially when providing fast regulation service. It is profitable for battery storage to extend its service life by limiting its operational strategy to some degree. Thus, we incorporate a battery cycle life model into a profit maximization model to determine the optimal bids in day-ahead energy, spinning reserve, and regulation markets. Then a decomposed online calculation method to compute cycle life under different operational strategies is proposed to reduce the complexity of the model. This novel bidding model would help investor-owned battery storages better decide their bidding and operational schedules and investors to estimate the battery storage's economic viability. The validity of the proposed model is proven by case study results.},

The aggregator portfolio optimization model should include inevitable deviations between day-ahead cleared bids and actual real-time energy purchases as well as uncertainty for the energy content of regulation signals in order to ensure profit maximization and reliable reserve provision. Energy deviations are characterized as “uninstructed” or “instructed” depending on whether or not the responsibility resides with the aggregator. Price deviations and statistical characteristics of regulation signals are also investigated. Finally, a new battery model is proposed for better approximation of the battery charging characteristic.

Results indicate that the conventional strategy of employing local wind, solar, and storage to realize 80\% renewable penetration by 2050 would incur a formidable decarbonization cost of \$27/ton despite lower levelized costs for renewables. Coordinated deployment of renewables, ultra-high-voltage transmissions, storages, Power-togas and slow-charging electric vehicles can reduce this carbon abatement cost to as low as \$À25/ton.

Conventional coordinated optimization methods, such as the Lagrangian relaxation and Benders decomposition, require iterative information exchange among subsystems. Iterative coordination methods have drawbacks including slow convergence, risk of oscillation and divergence, and incapability of multi-level optimization problems. To this end, this paper aims at the non-iterative coordinated optimization method for hierarchical power systems. The theory of the equivalent projection (EP) is proposed, which makes external equivalence of the optimal dispatch model of the subsystem. Based on the EP theory, a coordinated optimization framework is developed, where each subsystem submits the EP model as a substitute for its original model to participate in the cross-system coordination. The proposed coordination framework is proven to guarantee the same optimality as the joint optimization, with additional benefits of avoiding iterative information exchange, protecting privacy, compatibility with practical dispatch scheme, and capability of multi-level problems.},

We derive the mathematical formulation of the exact aggregate feasible region (AFR) of multiple DERs. The derivation is based on analyzing the redundancy of all possible constraints in the Fourier-Motzkin Elimination (FME) process. In the exact AFR model, the number of constraints is regardless of the number of DERs but exponential with the number of time intervals. Although the computational complexity of the exact AFR is dramatically simpliﬁed compared with the original FME, there are still too many constraints for the exact AFR model to be applied in practice. Hence, we propose the kth-order approximate models and two types of multi-timescale approximate models. Illustrative cases show the necessity of each constraint in the proposed models compared with the aggregated power and energy boundary model. Numerical simulations verify the accuracy of the exact AFR model. Besides, the secondorder approximate model performs best considering the balance between accuracy, economics, and computational complexity.},

At the lower level, we design priority-list based scheduling algorithm for each load type to allocate the resulting power trajectory to individual loads. We then present several numerical examples to compare the performance of the framework against three benchmarks including a fully centralized, globally optimal approach. We ﬁnd that, while the centralized framework is computationally intractable at even modest numbers of loads, the hierarchical framework scales very well to large numbers of loads and results in electricity costs that are comparable to the centralized benchmark.},

This article proposes an aggregate operation model to efficiently manage a large number of DERs with heterogeneous parameters. The aggregate operation model includes the approximate feasible region and the equivalent operational cost function. First, considering the coupling of power, energy, and regulation service, the operational flexibility of multiple categories of DERs is modeled by a general polytope. Second, by scaling and translating a basic homothetic polytope, a maximum inner aggregation approach is formulated to exploit the potential flexibility of DERs and guarantee solution feasibility. The uncertainty of DERs is modeled by the distributionally robust chance-constrained program (DRCCP), and the equivalent cost function of the DER aggregator is rigidly derived. Last, this study theoretically explains that the aggregate feasible region can be enlarged by introducing the DER clustering process, and a spectral clustering algorithm based on the multi-scale similarity metric method is developed to classify DERs into different aggregators. Numerical simulation results indicate the great potential of the proposed method to enhance system operational flexibility with high computational efficiency.},

This paper introduces a generic and scalable approach for ﬂexible energy systems to quantitatively describe and price their ﬂexibility based on zonotopic sets. The description allows aggregators to efﬁciently aggregate the ﬂexibility of large numbers of systems and to make control and market decisions on the aggregate level. In addition, an algorithm is presented that distributes aggregate-level control decisions among the individual systems of the population in an economically fair and computationally efﬁcient way.

While the ARO framework can actually be borrowed to solve some special problems without uncertain parameters, such as the power ﬂexibility aggregation problem studied in this paper. To effectively harness the signiﬁcant ﬂexibility from massive distributed energy resources (DERs), power ﬂexibility aggregation is performed for a distribution system to compute the feasible region of the exchanged power at the substation over time. Based on two-stage ARO, this paper proposes a novel method to aggregate system-level multi-period power ﬂexibility, considering heterogeneous DER facilities, network operational constraints, and an unbalanced power ﬂow model. This method is applicable to aggregate only the active (or reactive) power, and the joint active-reactive power domain. Accordingly, two power aggregation models with two-stage optimization are developed: one focuses on aggregating active power and computes its optimal feasible intervals over multiple periods, and the other solves the optimal elliptical feasible regions for the aggregate active-reactive power. By leveraging the ARO technique, the disaggregation feasibility of the obtained feasible regions is guaranteed with optimality. Numerical simulations on a real-world distribution feeder with 126 multi-phase nodes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Bundling a large number of distributed energy resources through a load aggregator has been advocated as an effective means to integrate such resources into wholesale energy markets. To ease market clearing, system operators allow aggregators to submit bidding models of simple prespecified polytopic shapes. Aggregators need to carefully design and commit to a polytope that best captures their energy flexibility along a day-ahead scheduling horizon. This work puts forth a model-informed data-based optimal flexibility design for aggregators, which deals with the time-coupled, uncertain, and non-convex models of individual loads. The proposed solution first generates efficiently a labeled dataset of (in)-feasible aggregation schedules. The feasible set of the aggregator is then approximated by an ellipsoid upon training a convex quadratic classifier using the labeled dataset. The ellipsoid is subsequently inner approximated by a polytope. Using Farkas’ lemma, the obtained polytope is finally inner approximated by the polytopic shape dictated by the market. Numerical tests show the effectiveness of the proposed flexibility design framework for designing the feasible sets of small- and large-sized aggregators coordinating solar photovoltaics, thermostatically-controlled loads, batteries, and electric vehicles. The tests further demonstrate that it is crucial for the aggregator to consider time-coupling and uncertainties in optimal flexibility design.},

	abstract = {The rapidly expanding scale of electric vehicle (EV) fleets and continuously decreasing battery costs are making vehicle-to-grid services a reality. In this paper, we study the interaction between the problems of an EV aggregator’s bidding in the regulation market and power allocation (i.e., determining the (dis)charging powers of the EVs in regulation deployment). Although the two problems are coupled, they are often regarded as decoupled and optimized separately for complexity issues. However, failing to consider the coupling of bidding and power allocation can lead to a decline in the profit of the EV aggregator (EVA). In this paper, we propose a framework for co-optimizing EVA bidding and power allocation in the regulation market. The bidding model is formulated as a stochastic programming problem with embedded power allocation in discretized regulation signal scenarios. To meet the solution time requirement for regulation deployment, we further propose a power allocation model that can be solved online. It utilizes the Lagrange multipliers from the bidding problem to ensure that the allocation results correspond to the optimal solution of the bidding problem. The effect of the proposed framework on improving EVA profits and reducing degradation costs is verified in the case study.},

	abstract = {With a large-scale integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), distribution systems are expected to be capable of providing capacity support for the transmission grid. To effectively harness the collective flexibility from massive DER devices, this paper studies distribution-level power aggregation strategies for transmission-distribution interaction. In particular, this paper proposes a method to model and quantify the aggregate power flexibility, i.e., the net power injection achievable at the substation, in unbalanced distribution systems over time. Incorporating the network constraints and multi-phase unbalanced modeling, the proposed method obtains an effective approximate feasible region of the net power injection. For any aggregate power trajectory within this region, it is proved that there exists a feasible disaggregation solution. In addition, a distributed model predictive control (MPC) framework is developed for practical implementation of the transmission-distribution interaction. At last, we demonstrate the performances of the proposed method via numerical tests on a real-world distribution feeder with 126 multi-phase nodes.},
